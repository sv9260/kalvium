            <h2>Strong Opposition to Ruling Party BJP</h2>
            <p>The 2024 General Elections have demonstrated a substantial challenge to the BJP's dominance by several key opposition parties. The Indian National Congress (INC) has secured 99 seats, reinforcing its position as the primary opposition force. Alongside INC, the Samajwadi Party (SP) with 37 seats and the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) with 29 seats have also emerged as significant contenders. These parties, with their strong regional bases and distinct political agendas, collectively form a formidable opposition, aiming to address various national and regional issues and provide a balanced governance structure.</p>
